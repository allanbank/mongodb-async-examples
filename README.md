## Examples using the MongoDB Asynchronous Java Driver

This project contains various examples that demonstrate the use of the [MongoDB Aysnchronous Driver](http://www.allanbank.com/mongodb-async-driver). 

All of the demos are self contained applications that can be quickly run to demonstrate various features of the driver. 

All of the demos assume that the MongoDB server is running on the local machine on the default port of 27017. If this is not the case look in the source for the MongoDB URI like: ```mongodb://localhost:27017/``` and change as appropriate.

Feel free to experiment with the examples and but please do not point the demos at your production cluster. Most of the demos delete the data in the test collection at the start of the demo so they are in a known state.
